Abstract
--------

This online resource called "A Gentoo Linux Advanced Reference Architecture" is
meant as a resource displaying the powerful features of many free software
solutions that are supported on top of Gentoo Linux. It is a deep-dive approach
in many aspects related to processes, supportability, maintainability based on
Gentoo Linux system deployments.

Unlike the existing, per-application documents that exist on the Internet (and
which are a valuable resource to get into the gory details of many applications)
and the per-distribution guides that provide information on using that particular
distribution, this book will focus more on architecturing IT infrastructure for
medium- to large sized enterprises. Smaller enterprises might find the reference
architecture here too expensive or large - however, many services described in
the book can be slimmed down into a smaller deployment as well.

It is seriously recommended to have a good grasp of what Gentoo Linux is to start
with. The other online resource ("Linux Sea") can be a good introduction to Gentoo
Linux, but that might not be sufficient to appreciate the detail and organization
of this book.

This resource will progress rather slowly (compared to the initial development of
"Linux Sea" as its content will be written down as I teach myself the technologies
mentioned within. When the development of this book started, knowledge about the
technical services described later is still limited, and the book will be used as
a sort-of progress report by the author. Call it offsite knowledge storage ;-) 

The current version is 1 and has been generated on 2015/06/10.
