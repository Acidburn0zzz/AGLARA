Postfix Administration Documentation
====================================

This document is intended for *system administrators* (or more precisely,
*operating system administrators*) who have to deal with Postfix deployments.
The document will not talk about Postfix administration itself, but merely about
how Postfix works on a system and how it interacts with the outside world.
