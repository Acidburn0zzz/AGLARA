E-mail
======

Although somewhat old-school, e-mail is still one of the most used collaboration
and communication methods out there. It is used by both end users as well as
applications (which often send automated e-mails).

E-mail services include, but are not limited to:

* routing and queueing of e-mails
* anti-malware and spam filtering
