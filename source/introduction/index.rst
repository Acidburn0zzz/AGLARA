When dealing with larger environments, IT infrastructure architecture will be
voiced as a common term. It is the "art" of capturing organizational
requirements, translating them into well defined services, creating building
blocks that adhere to the functional and non-functional requirements,
integrating those building blocks in a larger deployment design and finally
translating this into physical deployments on your infrastructure. For small
deployments (a few servers) this is probably not really beneficial to do so
intensively - most administrators in such cases do the entire architecturing in
their head. Because of the small scale, this is perfectly doable, although there
is something to say about properly documenting it anyhow.

Larger scale deployments (several hundreds servers, possibly even thousands
which might also be deployed across multiple sites) are more of a concern here,
usually because the requirements put into the architecture by the organization
are more broadly defined and focus on things such as maintainability or
manageability, enhanced security, ... These requirements are often written down
into process-like approaches on how to deal with your infrastructure, because
that improves the quality of activities done on your infrastructure and provides
a way to streamline hand over of activities or jobs within the organization.

When dealing with large-scale free software deployments, this is not different.
The next few sections elaborate on how to match requirements and which processes 
to look at.
