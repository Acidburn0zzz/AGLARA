AGLARA is the acronym of "A Gentoo Linux Advanced Reference Architecture".

Its purpose is to document and explain /A/ possible implementation of Gentoo
Linux for medium-sized enterprises. It will dive into the gory details of
various free software tools and sets and use Gentoo Linux as the distribution of
choice, although it must be said that many of the aspects described in it also
work on other distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux.

The idea of creating a reference architecture is based on my experience with
free software and the wonderful tools it contains, but the lower experience on a
more mature enterprise level of the many documents surrounding it.

If you are an administrator for a small enterprise, this might still be a good
resource for you, but you'll find some (or many) of its details to be "overhead"
for such smaller environments.
