  <section>
    <title>Getting a grip on IP addresses</title>

    <para>When you're dealing with a larg(er) network, you'll quickly run into
    the wonderful challenge of properly defining network segments and the
    allowed interaction between them. I personally like to keep segments based
    on its accessibility: internal business services, management services,
    customer business services, internal users, etc. Based on these
    accessibility patterns it is then easier to define the settings (and
    security measurements) for each.</para>

    <para>Within this reference architecture, I will be using IPv6 (as it
    proves to be a nice exercise, but also to show that IPv6 is not something
    to be afraid of) and a logical way of naming the hosts and services using
    DNS names. In this book, the used DNS names will reflect the function and
    "position" of the services in the architecture, but you are not required
    to follow this. Some organizations even want to keep the naming
    conventions of their services (including DNS) as obscure as possible, not
    to give too much information available when a leak occurs.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Example network segment</title>

      <para>The following code listing gives a high-level impression on the
      network segments identified for use in this book. I will be using the
      IPv6<indexterm>
          <primary>IPv6</primary>
        </indexterm> documentation range (2001:db8::/32) but this too is not
      something you need to follow. If your organization is assigned a proper
      IPv6 block, there is no reason to still use local addresses in your
      organization: the number of IPv6 addresses is
      <emphasis>currently</emphasis> sufficiently large to give each
      server/service in your organization its own address which, through
      routers, gateways and firewalls, is either accessible or not from
      anyplace.</para>

    <section>
      <title>IPv6 Addresses and DNS naming</title>

      <para>As we will be using IPv6, a quick run-down of how our network will
      be structured...</para>

      <section>
        <title>IPv6 address scheme</title>

        <para>First, below you'll find an example IPv6 address that could be
        used for a workstation</para>

        <programlisting>2001:0db8:0081:00e2:0000:0204:de89:330f</programlisting>

        <para>In abbreviated form, this becomes</para>

        <programlisting>2001:db8:81:e2::204:de89:330f</programlisting>

        <para>If we use a 64-bit host identifier (which, in IPv6 parlance, is
        called the EUI-64 address) and use the NIC's MAC address (which is 48
        bits), this means that our address can be seen roughly as
        follows:</para>

        <programlisting>2001:0db8:0081:00e2:0000:0204:de89:330f
&lt;------+------&gt;&lt;-+-&gt;&lt;--------+---------&gt;
       |         |           `- 64 bits host identifier
       |         `- 16 bits subnetwork identifier
       `- 48 bits prefix</programlisting>

        <para>In this case,</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>2001:db8:81 is the prefix assigned to us by our ISP</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>00e2 is our 16-bits subnet identifier (which we use to
            "regulate" our internal segmentation)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>0000:0204:de89:330f is our host identification (which is the
            MAC address + "0000" as padding to make it 64-bit wide).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This gives us plenty of room to create network segmentation
        rules. So for the remainder of this book, we will use the following
        subnet scheme. I have little experience with network segmentation
        rules or design, so if I'm totally missing a point somewhere here,
        please do tell me - I'm eager to learn more about this.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The first 4 bits are set to 0 (and left as a possible
            extension later)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The next 4 bits provide feedback on the environment:
            production (0), testing (1) or lab (2)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The next 4 bits give information about the system or device
            purpose. For instance, networking device (0), storage device (1),
            management server (2), business server (3), DMZ (8), workstation
            VPN (c), portable device (d), internal workstation (e)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The last 4 bits are used for subnets within the defined
            location</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>So the subnetwork identifier 00e2 given earlier gives us a
        production internal workstation on subnet "2".</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DNS Naming</title>

        <para>We will use logical names for our components. The domain
        "genfic.com" is used for the organization, "internal.genfic.com" is
        for all internal services.</para>

        <para>For instance, la00010.workstation.internal.genfic.com is an
        internal workstation; rtr01e2.network.internal.genfic.com is a router
        for the network, etc. I just let my imagination free - but keep the
        names consistent so that, if I talk about a server called
        gc01n01.virt.internal.genfic.com, it doesn't make you frown when I say
        it is the ganeti cluster 01, node 01 within the production virtualized
        network of the organization.</para>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>DNS</title>

    <para>So with our IP address range in place and a imaginative domain name
    structure in place, let's start the setup of our next component -
    DNS<indexterm>
        <primary>DNS</primary>
      </indexterm>.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Domain name servers</title>

      <para>Many organizations will host their own domain name servers. In our
      reference architecture, we will be using BIND, although I am hoping to
      support djbdns very soon (as a worthy opponent to the tried and true
      BIND<indexterm>
          <primary>BIND</primary>
        </indexterm>). The djbdns implementation has very positive critics,
      both regarding ease of use, performance as well as security. However,
      its main downside currently is that it doesn't fully support IPv6 yet -
      most functionality is supported, but as long as things like dnstrace,
      NS/MX records etc. do not support IPv6, I will be using BIND.</para>

      <section>
        <title>On BIND</title>

        <para>On the Internet, Berkeleys Internet Name Domain (BIND) server is
        the most popular DNS server to date. It has been plagued by its set of
        security issues, but is still very well supported on Gentoo (and
        other) platforms. The software was originally developed at Berkeley in
        the early 80s in an open source model. Since 2010, the software is
        maintained by the Internet Systems Consortium.</para>

        <para>Because it has such a large history, it has also seen quite a
        few updates and even rewrites. The current major version (BIND 9) is a
        rewrite that was tailored to answer the various secrity-related
        concerns that came from earlier versions. Sadly, even BIND 9 has seen
        its set of security vulnerabilities. Although a new major is in the
        making (BIND 10) it is not expected to be released anytime
        soon.</para>

        <para>To support a higher security within BIND, we will of course be
        running it confined within a SELinux domain and using chroot (which,
        together with grSecurity's chroot restrictions, offer a fairly good
        jail for this service). I am not enabling DNSSEC</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Chrooted master-slave architecture</title>

        <para>Naming services are an important part in an architecture. If
        your systems cannot resolve a hostname to an IP address, they will
        most likely not function correctly. We will implement a master-slave
        architecture, but where we can "upgrade" the slave to the master role
        if necessary. We will be using BIND's master/slave functionality,
        chrooted into <filename>/var/named/chroot</filename>.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>High-level BIND architecture</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>For the BIND architecture, we see the following feeds or
        activities involved:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>XFER-PULL</emphasis> is initiated from the
            secundary name server (the slave) which periodically connects to
            the master to get changes on the zone files</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>SIGNAL-XFER</emphasis> is initiated by the master
            name server and is a feature in BIND9 to signal its slave servers
            when changes have occurred</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>CMDB-FEED</emphasis> is a file transfer initiated
            from the central configuration management system (Puppet) which
            contains node information (IP address versus expected hostname and
            domain name) and is used to locally regenerate the zone
            files.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>We explicitly mention the system logger here as it will be
        configured to read log entries from the log socket in the chrooted
        environment.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Installing bind</title>

        <para>First, install net-dns/bind.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge net-dns/bind net-dns/bind-tools</command>
# <command>rc-update add named default</command></programlisting>

        <para>Next, edit <filename>/etc/conf.d/named</filename> and set the
        CHROOT variable. Make sure that this destination directory doesn't
        exists, or is empty otherwise:</para>

        <programlisting>CHROOT="/var/named/chroot"</programlisting>

        <para>Finally, run the configuration steps provided by our friendly
        package maintainer:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge --config =net-dns/bind-9.8.1_p1</command></programlisting>

        <para>This will prepare the chroot for you. At the end of the steps,
        it will ask you to edit your system logger configuration to capture
        logging events from the chrooted environment as well.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>vim /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf</command>
(... Add the next line ...)
source jail { unix-stream("/var/named/chroot/dev/log"); };</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Initial configuration</title>

        <para>We will start with an initial configuration of BIND.</para>

        <para>Let's start with
        <filename>/var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>named.conf</primary>
          </indexterm>:</para>

        <programlisting>options {
  directory "/var/bind";
  pid-file "/var/run/named/named.pid";
  statistics-file "/var/run/named/named.stats";
  listen-on { 127.0.0.1; };
  listen-on-v6 { 2001:db8:81:21::1bac:98ad:5fe1; };
  allow-query { any; };
  zone-statistics yes;
  allow-transfer { 2001:db8:81:22::7aae:6b01:e3d8; };
  notify yes;
  recursion no;
  version "[nope]";
}

# Access to DNS for local addresses (i.e. genfic-owned)
view "local" {
  match-clients { 2001:db8:81::/48; };
  recursion yes;
  zone "genfic.com" { type master; file "pri/com.genfic"; };
  zone "1.8.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa" { type master; fiel "pri/inv.com.genfic"; };
}</programlisting>

        <para>That's it. The configuration will have this installation work as
        the master DNS server and will (only) accept DNS requests from IPv6
        addresses within our IP range. For these requests, we use the
        <filename>pri/com.genfic</filename> file (which is our "zone" file
        that will contain the DNS records) and
        <filename>pri/inv.com.genfic</filename>" for the reverse lookups. We
        will also create a cache</para>

        <para>For the slave server, the setup is fairly similar:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>do not set the <parameter>allow-transfer</parameter> though.
            It is a slave server.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>set the type of the zone's to "<parameter>slave</parameter>"
            instead and add in <userinput>masters {
            2001:db8:81:21::1bac:98ad:5fe1; }</userinput> to each zone. That
            will tell BIND what the master is of this particular zone.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Finally, set the initial zone files for the organization.</para>

        <title>Automatically generating zone files</title>

        <para>Managing the zone files can be done using regular text files,
        but for larger environments, it is interesting to have an interface
        that does it for you. Later in the reference architecture, we will be
        setting up a central management location for our server management.
        This central configuration management database (well, it might not be
        a database by itself, but the term is correct) will be used to
        automatically generate zone files and push them to the name

    <title>DHCP</title>

    <para>When you have systems that require dynamically allocated IP
    addresses, you will need a DHCP service.</para>

    <para>DHCP<indexterm>
        <primary>DHCP</primary>
      </indexterm> stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and is the
    de-facto standard for dynamic IP allocation. In our architecture, we will
    be using DHCP for the workstations, VPN and other devices that are in the
    "bring your own device" pool, because all those devices might be started
    on different locations and as such are difficult to manage with fixed IP
    addresses.</para>

    <section>
      <title>DHCP Architecture</title>

      <para>Within our architecture, we will be positioning two DHCP servers
      internally, in an active/active setup. The systems will get information
      about the leases given by the other DHCP server so that it can take over
      when the other one is down. We also implement DHCP relay daemons within
      the target subnets where the workstations and other devices will need
      one.</para>

      <section>
        <title>General architecture</title>

        <para>The next figure displays the general architecture being put in

            <para>The relay server forwards the request

      <title>Installation and configuration</title>

      similar to BIND, uses flat files for its configuration.</para>

        <title>Installation</title>

        <para>First install the DHCP server. We will use ISC's DHCP server

        <para>The key in the configuration file is to be generated using the
        dnssec-keygen command:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n HOST primaryserver</command></programlisting>

        <para>This command creates two files, one ending in
        <filename>.key</filename> and one in <filename>.private</filename>.
        The one ending with <filename>.key</filename> is the one you need. Its
        last column contains the secret of this particular system and is the
        one you need to use (instead of "nope" in the example above).</para>

        <para>Finally, start the service and register it to automatically
        start during boot.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>rc-update add dhcpd default</command>
# <command>rc-service dhcpd start</command></programlisting>

        <para>You might be wondering why we call it a master in an
        active/active setup. That's what the <parameter>split</parameter>
        statement is for. With it set to 128, the DHCP servers will decide
        which server takes on the allocation of the requested IP address. Only
        when the other node is down will the system handle all DHCP
        requests.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Secundary DHCP server</title>

        <para>The configuration of the secundary DHCP server is similar. Just
        substitute "primaryserver" with "secondaryserver" (its just a name,
        not a mandatory string), use "<parameter>secondary;</parameter>" as
        option in the failover setting and <emphasis>do not</emphasis> place
        <parameter>mclt</parameter> and <parameter>split</parameter> in
        it.</para>

        <para>Don't forget to generate the key for this server as well, using
        "secondaryserver" as the name now.</para>

        <title>Relay services</title>

        <para>When you configure a relay service, edit /etc/conf.d/dhcrelay
        and set the DHCRELAY_OPTS accordingly.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>cat /etc/conf.d/dhcrelay</command>
DHCRELAY_OPTS="-6 -l eth0 -u 2001:db8:81:21::19f4:3303:40f4%eth0 -u 2001:db8:81:22::a05f:3853:fe78%eth0"</programlisting>

        <para>Then start up the relay service and make sure it starts at boot
        time as well.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>rc-update add dhcrelay default</command>
# <command>rc-service dhcrelay start</command></programlisting>
