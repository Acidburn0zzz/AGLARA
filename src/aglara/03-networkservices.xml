    <title>Getting a grip on IP addresses</title>

    <para>When you're dealing with a larg(er) network, you'll quickly run into
    the wonderful challenge of properly defining network segments and the
    allowed interaction between them. I personally like to keep segments based
    on its accessibility: internal business services, management services,
    customer business services, internal users, etc. Based on these
    accessibility patterns it is then easier to define the settings (and
    security measurements) for each.</para>

      <title>Example network segment</title>

      <para>In this reference architecture, we will be using IPv6 (as it
      proves to be a nice exercise, but also to show that IPv6 is not
      something to be afraid of).</para>

    <para>Use logical names, like gc02n01.hosts.genfic.com -&gt; ganeti
    cluster 02, node 01 on the hosts.genfic.com (production network). Or
    gc04n02.testing.hosts.genfic.com (testing network).</para>
