  <section>
    <title>Gentoo Linux</title>

    <para>Within the reference architecture, we standardize on Gentoo Linux.
    Standardization on a single platform is needed to keep costs sufficiently
    low, but also offers the advantage that you can use solutions specific for
    this platform, rather than having to look for solutions that must support
    a multitude of platforms. Of course, the choice of picking Gentoo Linux
    here might seem weird - why not CentOS (as that has a possible commercial
    backing towards RedHat Enterprise Linux when needed)?</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First of all - I'm a Gentoo Linux developer. Its the
        distribution I know the best.</para>

        <para>But in light of our fictional company, it might also be because
        its current (fictional) engineers are all Gentoo Linux developers, or
        because it has ties with regional Gentoo Linux supporting services. In
        light of many organizations, when there is choice between Linux
        distributions, one thing to consider is which distribution your
        engineers are most likely to work with. I know, asking them will
        probably result in some heavy fighting to see which distribution is
        best (perhaps you can use the <link
        xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorset
        method</link> to find the best selection), but picking a distribution
        your engineers are less eager to support will result in bad
        administration anyhow.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The reason to use CentOS (RHEL) could be to have certified
        hosting of certain products which are only supported on RHEL (or
        similar). However, because we will only use free software solutions,
        this requirement is not valid in our case. But it is understandable
        that companies that do run propriatary software choose a distribution
        that is supported by their vendors.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Gentoo Linux offers a fairly flexible approach on supported
        features. Thanks to a good balance of USE flags, we can install
        servers and services that offer just those services we need, without
        any additional dependencies or features that we will have to disable
        (in order to secure the services) anyhow. This leads to somewhat
        better performance, but also to a saving in storage requirements,
        patching frequency, etc. Gentoo is also quite fast in adopting new
        technologies, which might help the business stand out against the
        other competitors.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Gentoo uses rolling upgrades. That might not seem like a good
        way in enterprises, but trust me - it is. If an organization is doing
        things right, it is already distributing and rolling out patches and
        minor upgrades regularly. With Gentoo, this process is a bit more
        intrusive (as it might contain larger changes as well) but because the
        administrators are used to it, it is very much under control. As a
        result, whereas other organizations have to schedule large (expensive
        and time-consuming) upgrades every 3 to 5 years, Gentoo just moves
        along...</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Gentoo has a subproject called Gentoo Hardened who strives to
        provide security-improving patches on the base system. This project
        has always been a fore-runner in security mitigation
        strategies.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Of course, because this book is called "A Gentoo Linux Advanced
    Reference Architecture", it would be weird to have it talk about another
    distribution, wouldn't it?</para>

    <para>Now, the selection of Gentoo Linux also has a few challenges up its
    sleeve.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Gentoo Linux is primarily a source-based distribution, which is
        frequently frowned upon in the enterprise market. Weirdly enough, they
        don't find it strange that their development and operational teams
        keep on building frameworks and tools themselves because of lack of
        good tools. This is exactly where Gentoo Linux outshines the others:
        it offers many tools out-of-the-box to support every possible
        requirement.</para>

        <para>To reduce the impact of its source-only stigma, we will be using
        build servers and binhost support for improved manageability.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Because of its source-based nature, it also provides all the
        tools for malicious users to build exploits on the server
        itself.</para>

        <para>In my opinion, it is fairly easy to hide the compiler or at
        least have some group-based access control on it. But regardless of
        that - the moment a malicious user has (shell) access to your system,
        you're screwed anyhow. It is fairly easy to transfer files (even full
        applications) towards the system then.</para>

        <para>To reduce possible impact here, we will be using a Mandatory
        Access Control system which isolates processes and even users very
        tightly.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>We will standardize on the x86_64 architecture (or in Gentoo's
    terms, amd64), partially because it is the widest known in the Gentoo
    Linux development community, but also because its hardware is widely
    available and sufficiently cheap. It is also a processor architecture that
    is constantly evolving and has many vendors working on it (less
    monopolizing strategies) which makes it a better platform for consumers in
    my opinion.</para>

    <para>That being said, we'll also use the no-multilib approach in Gentoo
    Linux. Systems need to be fully x86_64 driven, partially for
    standardization as well, but also to make debugging easier. The fewer
    special cases you need to think about, the faster you can resolve
    problems. Generally though, this gives little (to no) additinoal advantage
    towards a multilib profile. But as this is a reference architecture, I'll
    stick with this.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Gentoo Hardened</title>

      <para>To increase security of the deployments, all systems will use a
      Gentoo Hardened deployment. Within the Gentoo Linux community, Gentoo
      Hardened is a project that oversees the research, implementation and
      maintenance of security-oriented projects in Gentoo Linux. It focuses on
      delivering viable security strategies for high stability production
      environments and is therefor absolutely suitable for this reference
      architecture.</para>

      <para>Within our scope, we will implement all services on a Gentoo
      Hardened deployment with the following security measures in
      place:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>PaX</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>PIE/PIC/SSP</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>SELinux as MAC</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>grSecurity kernel improvements</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The installation of a Gentoo Hardened system is similar to a
      regular Gentoo Linux one. You can find all necessary information on the
      Gentoo Hardened project page. Later, we'll use images of a (succesful)
      installation for seeding new servers and systems.</para>

      <section>
        <title>PaX</title>

        <para>The PaX<indexterm>
            <primary>PaX</primary>
          </indexterm> project (part of grSecurity) aims to update the Linux
        kernel with <link
        xlink:href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/pax.txt">defense
        mechanisms</link> against exploitation of software bugs that allow an
        attacker access to the software's address space (memory). By
        exploiting this access, a malicious user could introduce or execute
        arbitrary code, execute existing code without the applications'
        intended behavior, or with different data than expected.</para>

        <para>One of the defence mechanisms introduced is NOEXEC<indexterm>
            <primary>NOEXEC</primary>
          </indexterm>. With this enabled, memory pages of an application
        cannot be marked writeable and executable. So either a memory page
        contains application code, but cannot be modified (kernel enforced),
        or it contains data and cannot be executed (kernel enforced). The
        enforcement methods used are beyond the scope of this book, but are
        described <link
        xlink:href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/noexec.txt">online</link>.
        Enforcing NOEXEC does have potential consequences: some applications
        do not work when PaX enforces this behavior. Because of this, PaX
        allows administrators to toggle the enforcement on a per-binary basis.
        For more information about this, see the Hardened Gentoo PaX
        Quickstart document (see resources at the end of this chapter). Note
        that this also requires PIE/PIC built code (see later).</para>

        <para>Another mechanism used is ASLR<indexterm>
            <primary>ASLR</primary>
          </indexterm>, or Address Space Layout Randomization. This thwarts
        attacks that need advance knowledge of addresses (for instance through
        observation of previous runs). With ASLR enabled, the address space is
        randomized for each application, which makes it much more difficult to
        guess where a certain code (or data) portion is loaded, and as such
        attacks will be much more difficult to execute succesfully. This
        requires the code to be PIE built.</para>

        <para>To enable PaX, you will need to install the hardened-sources
        kernel in Gentoo Linux and configure it according to the instructions
        found on the Hardened Gentoo PaX Quickstart document. You should also
        install <command>paxctl</command><indexterm>
            <primary>paxctl</primary>
          </indexterm>.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge hardened-sources</command>
# <command>emerge paxctl</command></programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>PIE/PIC/SSP</title>

        <para>The given abbreviations describe how source code is built into
        binary, executable code.</para>

        <para>PIC<indexterm>
            <primary>PIC</primary>
          </indexterm> (Position Independent Code) is used for shared
        libraries to support the fact that they are loaded in memory
        dynamically (and without prior knowledge to the addresses). Whereas
        older methods use load-time relocation (where address pointers are all
        rewritten the moment the code is loaded in memory), PIC uses a higher
        abstraction of indirection towards data and function references. By
        building shared objects with PIC, relocations in the text segment in
        memory (which contains the application code) are not needed anymore.
        As such, these pages can be marked as non-writeable.</para>

        <para>To find out if you have libraries that still support text
        relocations<indexterm>
            <primary>text relocation</primary>
          </indexterm>, you can install the pax-utils package and scan your
        libraries for text relocations:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge pax-utils</command>
$ <command>scanelf -lpqt</command>
TEXTREL  /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/libctxssl.so</programlisting>

        <para>In the above example, the libctxssl.so file is not built with
        PIC and as such could be more vulnerable to attacks as its
        code-containing memory pages might not be marked as
        non-writeable.</para>

        <para>With PIE<indexterm>
            <primary>PIE</primary>
          </indexterm> (Position Independent Executables) enabled, executables
        are built in a fashion similar to shared objects: their base address
        can be relocated and as such, PaX' ASLR method can be put in effect to
        randomize the address in use. An application binary that is PIE-built
        will show up as a shared object file rather than an executable file
        when checking its ELF header</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>readelf -h /bin/ls | grep Type</command>
  Type:            DYN (Shared object file)

$ <command>readelf -h /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/wfcmgr.bin | grep Type</command>
  Type:            EXEC (Executable file)</programlisting>

        <para>SSP<indexterm>
            <primary>SSP</primary>
          </indexterm> finally stands for Stack Smashing Protection. Its
        purpose is to add in additional buffers after memory allocations (for
        variables and such) which contain a cryptographic marker (often called
        the canary). When an overflow occurs, this marker is also overwritten
        (after all, that's how overflows work). When a function would return,
        this marker is first checked to see if it is still valid. If not, then
        an overflow has occurred and the application is stopped
        abruptly.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Checking PaX and PIE/PIC/SSP results</title>

        <para>If you want to verify the state of your system after applying
        the security measures identified earlier, install paxtest and run it.
        The application supports two modes: kiddie and blackhat. The blackhat
        test gives the worst-case scenario back whereas the kiddie-mode runs
        tests that are more like the ones script-kiddies would run. The
        paxtest application simulates certain attacks and presents plausible
        results to the reader.</para>

        <para>These are virtually the same tests as before, but now the

        <para>The randomisation tests try to find out which level of
        randomisation is put in place. Although randomisation by itself does
        not offer protection, it obscures the view malicious users have on the
        memory structures. The higher the randomisation, the better. On Gentoo
        Hardened, (almost) all binaries are PIE.</para>

        <para>These types of attacks are very difficult to thwart by kernel
        protection measures only. The author of the paxtest application has
        put those in because he can, even though he knows PaX does not protect
        against them. In effect, he tries to show users that PaX is not an
        all-safe method and that additional security layers are still
        important.</para>

          </indexterm> (Mandatory Access Control<indexterm>
            <primary>Mandatory Access Control</primary>

        are allowed and which not, and can enforce that the user cannot
        override this. Regular access patterns in Linux are discretionary, so
        the user can define this himself. In this book, we will use
        SELinux<indexterm>
            <primary>SELinux</primary>
          </indexterm> as the MAC system. Another supported MAC in Gentoo
        Hardened is grSecurity's RBAC model.</para>

        <para>Installing and configuring Hardened Gentoo with SELinux is
        described in the Gentoo SELinux handbook. It is seriously recommended
        to read through this resource a few times, as SELinux is not just

        requires experience with it.</para>

        <para>We will use the SELinux strict policy (so no unconfined domains)

      <title>Installation choices</title>

      <para>During the initial installation of Gentoo, a few choices will
      already need to be made.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Partitioning and LVM</title>

        <para>In our architecture, we will be using directly attached storage
        (so no SAN nor NAS for every possible file system) and deal with the
        consequences of having distributed storage differently. One of the
        methods we will be using is to use LVM wherever we can, including for
        the root file system. I do recommend that the internal storage is
        somewhat protected against disk failure through RAID. Although I am a
        proponent of RAID1, <link
        xlink:href="http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/27/Linux%20Filesystem%20Performance%20for%20Databases%20Presentation.pdf">tests</link>
        have shown that RAID5 performs equally well.</para>

        <para>We will use a non-LVM partition (RAID1 protected) for the /boot
        location, and use LVM volumes for the rest. We will also define
        different volume groups for system versus data.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>pvcreate /dev/md1</command>
# <command>vgcreate vg_system /dev/md1</command>
# <command>lvcreate -l 20G -n lv_root vg_system</command>
# <command>lvcreate -l 10G -n lv_home vg_system</command></programlisting>

        <para>Through this approach, the root file system will be hosted on
        /dev/mapper/vg_system-lv_root and as such be expandable (if necessary)
        as well as protected by the underlying RAID system. If you keep enough
        free space in the volume group, you can work with snapshots to support
        flexible backup methods.</para>

        <para>Needless to say, you will need to boot with an initramfs.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>genkernel --install --lvm initramfs</command></programlisting>

        <para>Don't forget to update the bootloader configuration.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The /boot location</title>

        <para>I tend to keep my /boot location pretty "big" considering what
        other users think is needed: 1 Gbyte. Although the kernel and
        initramfs (plus boot loader files) are only a few megabytes, I often
        place a rescue environment in it (such as a <link
        xlink:href="http://www.sysresccd.org">sysresccd</link>) so that I can
        recover even when initramfs is unable to. It also allows me to install
        additional verification tools like memtest and the like.</para>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Virtualization using Ganeti and KVM</title>

    <para>When possible, we will use virtualization. This offers a hardware
    abstraction so that we can move guests from one hardware platform to
    another without having too much impact on the loaded drivers. We can build
    one kernel configuration and reuse that for all virtual guests in the
    architecture. Our udev rules can be tested once and then deployed with
    high confidence across all other guest systems.</para>

    <para>It also supports better availability models. A hardware failure in a
    physical system is disastrous for the services hosted on that system. In
    case of virtualized systems, when the underlying hardware fails, we can
    reboot the virtual guest on a new hardware platform. As long as it is
    hosted in the same subnet, the virtual guest hardly notices it (beyond
    that it was suddenly down of course). With the proper supporting
    frameworks, the downtime of the guests can be as low as a few
    minutes.</para>

    <para>Virtualization also offers improved resource usage. A physical
    system usually has a low resource consumption (with a CPU usage of less
    than 10%) even though the system is taking up floor/rack space, providing
    heat, taking electricity etc. In a virtualized system, we have a much more
    condense situation. Properly balanced virtual hosts have a CPU consumption
    of about 80%, which results in more optimized resource consumption. This
    has a positive impact on the cost of running these servers.</para>

    <para>As virtualization platform, we will choose KVM as it offers many
    interesting features (both for development as well as larger enterprise
    usability) and is quite popular in the Linux development (and user)
    community. Other virtualization techniques that can be used are Xen or
    Virtualbox. Within Gentoo Linux however, KVM is most known.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Hypervisor kernel configuration</title>

      <para>A hypervisor<indexterm>
          <primary>hypervisor</primary>
        </indexterm> is the general term given to the host operating system
      that offers virtualization services, so in effect is running the virtual
      guests as processes (or groups of processes). In case of KVM<indexterm>
          <primary>KVM</primary>
        </indexterm>, this means that the Linux kernel will be configured with
      KVM enabled (and with the proper virtualization improvements on various
      drivers) as well as userland utilities to support KVM guests.</para>

      <para>Below you can find a subset of kernel configuration settings that
      can be used as a base for the configuration:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>zgrep -E '(KVM|VIRT)' /proc/config.gz</command>
# CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST is not set
CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS=y

# CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE is not set
# CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_VIRTIO is not set

CONFIG_KVM_ASYNC_PF=y
CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION=y
CONFIG_KVM=m
CONFIG_KVM_INTEL=m
# CONFIG_KVM_AMD is not set</programlisting>

      <para>Make sure that your hardware systems support hardware-assisted
      virtualization. For Intel processors, this means that vmx must be
      available; on AMD processors, this is svm:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo | head -1</command>
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat \

                  arat dts tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority ept vpid</programlisting>

      <para>Because we are aiming for a hypervisor kernel, it is best to
      remove all drivers not needed by the host. I am not directly opposed to
      using kernel modules versus a monolithic kernel, but if the
      configuration allows it, my preference goes to monolithic builds. This
      also has the advantage that the initramfs does not need to take care of
      kernel module loading.</para>

      <title>Software packages</title>

      <section>
        <title>Installing KVM Utilities</title>

        <para>To build up the hypervisor, you first need to install
        qemu-kvm<indexterm>
            <primary>qemu-kvm</primary>
          </indexterm>. This is the base platform under which the guests will
        run and supports all possible features you need in a virtualized
        environment.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>emerge qemu-kvm</command></programlisting>

        <para>The package listens to a lot of USE flags. Many of those are
        however to enable support for other architectures (as QEMU is a
        software virtualization platform which you can use even without
        hardware virtualization assistance). My advise is to at least enable
        aoi (Asynchronous I/O support), sasl (Simple Authentication and
        Security Layer support), threads, vde (Virtual Distributed Ethernet
        support) and vhost-net.</para>

        <para>The qemu-kvm package already provides command-line utilities
        that you can use to create image files, launch guests, set up
        networking etc. However, these commands are quite complex and,
        especially for distributed environments, difficult to manage...</para>

        <title>Selecting a virtualization framework</title>

        <para>To help administrators manage the virtual guests that are
        running on dozens of hosts, frameworks have emerged that lift some of
        the management tasks to a higher level. These frameworks offer
        automated generation of new guests, simplified configuration of the
        instances, remote management of guests. Some of them even support
        maintenance activities, such as moving guests from one host to
        another, or monitor the resource consumption of guests to find a good
        balance between running guests and available hosts.</para>

        <para>In Gentoo, many of these virtualization frameworks are
        supported.</para>

        <para>The first one is <package>app-emulation/libvirt</package> and is
        RedHat's virtualization management platform. The hypervisor systems
        run the libvirt daemon which manages the virtual guests as well as
        storage and other settings, and the administrator remotely connects to
        the various hypervisor systems through the
        <package>app-emulation/virt-manager</package> application. It has
        support for SELinux through its s(ecure)Virt(ualization) feature. To
        do so, it does require the MCS SELinux policy. Libvirt is also being
        used by many other frameworks (like oVirt, Archipel, Abiquo and
        more).</para>

        <para>Another one that is gaining momentum is
        <package>app-emulation/ganeti</package> and is backed by Google. It is
        foremost a command-line driven method but is well capable of handling
        dozens and dozens of hypervisor systems. It supports simplified
        fail-over on top of DRBD and makes an abstraction of the running hosts
        versus the guests. It bundles a set of hosts (which it calls nodes) in
        logical groups called clusters. The guests (instances) are then spread
        across the nodes in the cluster, and the administrator manages the
        cluster remotely.</para>

        <para>In this reference architecture, I will be using ganeti, but
        depending on how it works out, I might switch to the other later. The
        two (libvirt and ganeti) are equally strong, although libvirt has a
        much more active development community. On the other hand, Ganeti
        looks to be simpler in its design.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Installing ganeti</title>

        <para>The installation of ganeti is quite simple: install ganeti and
        ganeti-htools. If you are planning on providing a high-available
        virtualization platform, install drbd as well.</para>

      <title>Using Ganeti</title>

      <section>
        <title>Architectural information</title>

        <para>There are a few things you need to know before starting off with
        Ganeti, especially in light of architecturing its use.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Ganeti uses SSH and specific TCP (over SSL) connections. The
            use of SSH here might be something worth knowing, since it is used
            to support remote root activities on the nodes. You might want to
            take additional precautions to protect abuse of remote root
            logons. In the future, I will be providing a SELinux user specific
            for ganeti, and have remote root logons automatically assigned to
            this user, so it remains confined. There is also a <link
            xlink:href="https://code.google.com/p/ganeti/issues/detail?id=197">patch</link>
            circulating on the Internet that would support non-root
            logons.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The use of DRBD (for replication) within Ganeti is best kept
            for synchronisation within a single network segment (so "local"
            high availability). It is not the intention to use this across
            larger distances. DRBD by itself can still be used for that, but
            not in combination with booting the guest images. This is
            partially because the guest images will expect the same network
            environment when they boot up as previous.</para>

            <para>In our reference architecture, we will be using application
            fail-over when large-distance high availability is
            necessary.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Preparing DRBD</title>

        <para>Because high available virtual guests will be used in this
        reference architecture, we will be configuring DRBD.</para>

        <para>DRBD uses the network to synchronise block devices. It is
        adviseable to have a different network for this back-end communication
        versus the network used for front-end (business) activity. Logically
        speaking, we will have 3 network channels: one for the data flow of
        the services, one for the management activities and one for the
        back-end synchronisation. You can have all these channels on a single
        Ethernet if you want, but logically speaking, they are
        separate.</para>

        <para>In our architecture, we will be putting DRBD on top of LVM, and
        then use LVM again based on DRBD devices. This stacking of
        technologies has the downside of some complexity (and perhaps even
        performance impact) but has advantages that imo win against the
        downsides.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Because DRBD works on top of LVM, you can expand the size of
            the underlying LVM volume groups and logical volumes. DRBD
            supports on-line resizing.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Because DRBD works on top of LVM, you can use LVM snapshot
            technology to provide better resilience against failures.
            Especially during synchronisation, if the source fails and the
            target is in an inconsistent state, you will be glad to have a
            snapshot (on the receiving side) to work from.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Because LVM works on top of DRBD, you have the advantages of
            the volume manager for your image management functions while still
            benefiting from the high availability mode that DRBD
            offers.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>In the near future, I might include clustering file systems as
        well. However, for now, I am less convinced about the maturity of
        these file systems whereas I have read good reviews (and specifically
        many) on DRBD in production scenarios.</para>

        <para>To properly have DRBD for Ganeti, it is mandatory to run it with
        the following two options. The listing shows them as kernel
        parameters, but you can use them as module parameters as well (in
        /etc/conf.d/modules):</para>

        <programlisting>drbd.minor_count=255 drbd.usermode_helper=/bin/true</programlisting>

        <para>We also need to protect the DRBD devices from being scanned by
        LVM. To accomplish this, edit /etc/lvm/lvm.conf as follows:</para>

        <programlisting>filter = [ "r|/dev/nbd.*|", "a/.*/"<emphasis>, "r|/dev/drbd[0-9]+|"</emphasis> ]</programlisting>

        <para>Finally edit /etc/drbd.conf and skip all existing resource
        configurations. Ganeti will configure DRBD itself when needed.</para>

        <programlisting># <command>cat /etc/drbd.conf</command>
<emphasis>skip</emphasis> resource r0 {
  ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Preparing Ganeti</title>

        <para>Make sure that the hostname setting in
        <filename>/etc/conf.d/hostname</filename> provides a fully qualified
        hostname. Ganeti will otherwise refuse to function properly.</para>
